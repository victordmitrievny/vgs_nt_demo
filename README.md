Bob's Hamburger is a demo app designed to highlight secure payment processing through VGS data security platform (https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/). 
Whenever users submit their payment card information, the client side uses VGS collect library to securely post the form data to VGS inbound proxy, which tokenizes card number and cvc before passing it to the app's server side.

In this variation of the app, submitted card also enrrols into a Network Token and completes transaction using Network Token with Adyen
